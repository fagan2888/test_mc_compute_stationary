Test mc_compute_stationary from quantecon

Check whether all the elements of the computed stationary distribution are nonnegative
for the Markov matrix generated by the KMR model
with a large number of players or a very small probability of mutation.

Run

```sh
$ python test_mc_compute_stationary.py
```

or

```sh
$ python test_mc_compute_stationary.py --N 3 --epsilon 1e-14
```
